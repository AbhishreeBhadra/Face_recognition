# Face_recognition

Real-Time Face Recognition System

Description  
A real-time face recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. The project leverages a fine-tuned VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification, achieving 99% accuracy. It includes efficient image preprocessing, real-time face detection, and live inference for seamless performance.

Features  
- Real-time face detection and recognition using webcam.  
- Multi-class classification with high accuracy.  
- Fine-tuned VGG16 CNN model for robust predictions.  
- Scalable and modular codebase for future enhancements.

Acknowledgments  
- OpenCV for face detection using Haar cascades.  
- TensorFlow/Keras for model fine-tuning and predictions.  
- VGG16 pretrained CNN architecture for transfer learning.
